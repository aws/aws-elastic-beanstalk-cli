Docker Compose
==============
![Docker Compose](logo.png?raw=true "Docker Compose Logo")

## :exclamation: The docker-compose project announces that as Python 2 reaches it's EOL, versions 1.25.x will be the last to support it. For more information, please refer to this [issue](https://github.com/docker/compose/issues/6890).

Compose is a tool for defining and running multi-container Docker applications.
With Compose, you use a Compose file to configure your application's services.
Then, using a single command, you create and start all the services
from your configuration. To learn more about all the features of Compose
see [the list of features](https://github.com/docker/docker.github.io/blob/master/compose/index.md#features).

Compose is great for development, testing, and staging environments, as well as
CI workflows. You can learn more about each case in
[Common Use Cases](https://github.com/docker/docker.github.io/blob/master/compose/index.md#common-use-cases).

Using Compose is basically a three-step process.

1. Define your app's environment with a `Dockerfile` so it can be
reproduced anywhere.
2. Define the services that make up your app in `docker-compose.yml` so
they can be run together in an isolated environment.
3. Lastly, run `docker-compose up` and Compose will start and run your entire app.

A `docker-compose.yml` looks like this:

    version: '2'

    services:
      web:
        build: .
        ports:
         - "5000:5000"
        volumes:
         - .:/code
      redis:
        image: redis

For more information about the Compose file, see the
[Compose file reference](https://github.com/docker/docker.github.io/blob/master/compose/compose-file/compose-versioning.md).

Compose has commands for managing the whole lifecycle of your application:

 * Start, stop and rebuild services
 * View the status of running services
 * Stream the log output of running services
 * Run a one-off command on a service
